#Paramap

##University Project
This is the GitHub repository for the Paramap mobile application built within the Design and Implementation of Mobile Applications course at **Politecnico di Milano University**.

The project aims to provide people with disabilities with accessibility information on the available facilities of nearby urban infrastructure. Now everyone may contribute to the development of society without barriers and stereotypes. It is very easy to take part in the project: just add information about available facilities to the application, comment and rate published locations. Each location may be rated based on one of the three aspects: entrance, parking and bathroom.

The project is implemented with **React Native**.
